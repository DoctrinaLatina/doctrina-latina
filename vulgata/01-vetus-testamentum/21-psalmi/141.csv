INTELLĒCTUS DĀVĪD CUM ESSET IN SPĒLUNCĀ ŌRĀTIŌ:^Of understanding for David, a prayer when he was in the cave:
Vōce meā ad Dominum clāmāvī, vōce meā ad Dominum deprecātus sum.^I cried to the Lord with my voice; with my voice I made supplication to the Lord.
Effundō in conspectū ejus deprecātiōnem meam, et trībulātiōnem meam ante ipsum pronuntiō.^In his sight I pour out my supplication, and before him I declare my trouble.
In deficiendō ex mē spīritum meum, et tū cognōvistī sēmitās meās. In viā hāc quā ambulābam abscondērunt laqueum mihi.^When my spirit failed me, then thou knewest my paths. In this way wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.
Consīderābam ad dexteram, et vidēbam, et nōn erat quī cognōsceret mē. Perīvit fuga a mē, et nōn est quī requīrat animam meam.^I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that would know me. Flight hath failed me, and there is no one that hath regard to my soul.
Clāmāvī ad tē, Domine; dīxī: Tū es spēs mea, portiō mea in terrā vīventium.^I cried to thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.
Intende ad deprecātiōnem meam, quia humiliātus sum nimis. Līberā mē a persequentibus mē, quia confortātī sunt super mē.^Attend to my supplication, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
Ēdūc dē cūstōdiā animam meam ad confitendum nōminī tuō; mē expectant jūstī dōnec retribuās mihi.^Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name; the just wait for me, until thou reward me.
