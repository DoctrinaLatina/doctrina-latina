10 ^ diēs annōrum nostrōrum in ipsīs, septuāgintā annī. Sī autem in potentātibus octōgintā annī, et amplius eōrum labor et dolor; quoniam supervēnit mansuētūdō, et corripiēmur. ^ the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years, and what is more of them is labour and sorrow; for mildness is come upon us, and we shall be corrected.
