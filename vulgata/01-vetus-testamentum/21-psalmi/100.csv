1 ^ Misericordiam et jūdicium cantābō tibi Domine. ^ Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee, O Lord.
2 ^ Psallem et intellegem in viā immaculātā, quandō veniēs ad mē. Perambulābam in innocentiā cordis meī, in mediō domūs meae. ^ I will sing and understand in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
3 ^ Nōn prōpōnēbam ante oculōs meōs rem injūstam; facientēs praevāricātiōnēs ōdīvī. ^ I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing; I hated the workers of iniquities.
4 ^ Nōn adhaesit mihī cor prāvum; dēclīnantem ā mē malignum nōn cognōscēbam. ^ The perverse heart did not cleave to me, and the malignant that turned aside from me I would not know.
5 ^ Dētrahentem sēcrētō proximō suō, hunc persequēbar; superbō oculō, et insatiābilī corde, quum hōc nōn edēbam. ^ The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did I persecute; with him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I would not eat.
6 ^ Oculī meī ad fidēlēs terrae, ut sedeant mēcum; ambulans in viā immaculātā, hic mihī ministrābat. ^ My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me; the man that walked in the perfect way, he served me.
7 ^ Nōn habitābit in mediō domūs meae quī facit superbiam; quī loquitur inīqua nōn dīrēxit in conspectū oculōrum meōrum. ^ He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house; he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.
8 ^ In mātūtīnō interficiēbam omnēs peccātōrēs terrae, ut disperderem dē cīvitāte Dominī omnēs operantēs inīquitātem. ^ In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.
