3 ^ Multī dīcunt animae meae: Nōn est salūs ipsī in Deō ejus. ^ Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.
4 ^ Tū autem, Domine, susceptor meus es, glōria mea, et exaltans caput meum. ^ But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.

7 ^ Nōn timēbō millia populī circumdantīs mē. Exsurge Domine; salvum mē fac Deus meus. ^ I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me. Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.
8 ^ Quoniam tū percussistī omnēs adversantēs mihi sine causā; dentēs peccātōrum contrīvistī. ^ For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
