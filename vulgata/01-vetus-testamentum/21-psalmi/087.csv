2 ^ Domine, Deus salūtis meae, in diē clāmāvī, et nocte cōram tē. ^ O Lord, the God of my salvation, by day I cried out, and at night before thee.
3 ^ Intret in conspectū tuō ōrātiō mea; inclīnā aurem tuam ad precem meam, ^ Let my prayer come in before thee; incline thy ear to my petition,
4 ^ quia replēta est malīs anima mea, et vīta mea infernō appropinquāvit. ^ for my soul is filled with evils, and my life hath drawn nigh to hell.
5 ^ Aestimātus sum cum dēscendentibus in lacum; factus sum sīcut homō sine adjūtōriō, ^ I am counted with them that go down to the pit; I am become as a man without help,
6 ^ inter mortuōs līber, Sīcut vulnerātī dormientēs in sepulchrīs, quōrum nōn es memor amplius, et ipsī dē manū tuā repulsī sunt. ^ free among the dead, like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more, and they are cut off from thy hand.
7 ^ Posuērunt mē in lacū inferiōrī, in tenebrōsīs, et in umbrā mortis. ^ They have laid me in the lower pit, in the dark places, and in the shadow of death.
8 ^ Super mē confirmātus est furor tuus, et omnēs flūctūs tuōs indūxistī super mē. ^ Thy wrath is strong over me, and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me.
9 ^ Longē fēcistī nōtōs meōs ā mē; posuērunt mē abōminātiōnem sibi. Trāditus sum, et nōn ēgrediēbar; ^ Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me; they have set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth;
10 ^ oculī meī languērunt prae inopiā. Clāmāvī ad tē Domine tōtā diē; expandī ad tē manūs meās. ^ my eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee, O Lord; I stretched out my hands to thee.
11 ^ Numquid mortuīs faciēs mīrābilia? Aut medicī suscitābunt, et confitēbuntur tibi? ^ Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee?
12 ^ Numquid narrābit aliquis in sepulchrō misericordiam tuam, et vēritātem tuam in perditiōne? ^ Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy, and thy truth in destruction?
13 ^ Numquid cognōscentur in tenebrīs mīrābilia tua? Et jūstitia tua in terrā oblīviōnis? ^ Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?
14 ^ Et egō ad tē, Domine, clāmāvī, et māne ōrātiō mea praeveniet tē. ^ But I, O Lord, have cried to thee, and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.
15 ^ Ut quid Domine repellis ōrātiōnem meam; āvertis faciem tuam ā mē? ^ Lord, why castest thou off my prayer; why turnest thou away thy face from me?
16 ^ Pauper sum egō, et in labōribus ā juventūte meā; exaltātus autem, humiliātus sum et conturbātus. ^ I am poor, and in labours from my youth; and being exalted, have been humbled and troubled.
17 ^ In mē transīvērunt īrae tuae, et terrōrēs tuī conturbāvērunt mē. ^ Thy wrath hath come upon me, and thy terrors have troubled me.
18 ^ Circumdedērunt mē sīcut aqua tōtā diē; circumdedērunt mē simul. ^ They have come round about me like water all the day; they have compassed me about together.
19 ^ Ēlongāvistī ā mē amīcum et proximum, et nōtōs meōs ā miseriā. ^ Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me, and my acquaintance because of misery.
