1 ^ Ecce quam bonum et quam jūcundum habitāre frātrēs in ūnum. ^ Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.
2 ^ Sīcut unguentum in capite, quod dēscendit in barbam, barbam Aarōnis, quod dēscendit in orram vestīmentī ejus; ^ Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, which ran down to the edge of his garment;
3 ^ sīcut rōs Hermōn, quī dēscendit in montem Siōnis. Quoniam illīc mandāvit Dominus benedictiōnem, et vītam usque in saeculum. ^ as the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there the Lord hath commanded blessing, and life for evermore.
