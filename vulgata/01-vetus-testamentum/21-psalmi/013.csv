1^Dīxit insapiens in corde suō: Nōn est Deus. Corruptī sunt, et abōminābilēs factī sunt in studiīs suīs; nōn est quī faciat bonum, nōn est usque ad ūnum.^The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God. They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their pursuits; there is none that doth good, no not one.
2^Dominus dē caelō prōspexit super fīliōs hominum, ut videat sī est intellegens, aut requīrens Deum.^The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.
3^Omnēs dēclīnāvērunt, simul inūtilēs factī sunt. Nōn est quī faciat bonum, nōn est usque ad ūnum.^They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together. There is none that doth good, no not one.
4^Nōnne cognōscent omnēs quī operantur inīquitātem, quī dēvorant plēbem meam sīcut ēscam pānis?^Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as the food of bread?
5^Dominum nōn invocāvērunt; illīc trepidāvērunt timōre, ubi nōn erat timor.^They have not called upon the Lord; there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.
6^Quoniam Dominus in generātiōne jūstā est; consilium inopis confūdistis, quoniam Dominus spēs ejus est.^For the Lord is in the just generation; you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope.
7^Quis dabit ex Sion salūtāre Isrāēl? Quum āverterit Dominus captīvitātem plēbis suae, exsultābit Jācōb, et laetābitur Isrāēl.^Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? When the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
