2 ^ Domine, nē in furōre tuō arguās mē, neque in īrā tuā corripiās mē. ^ Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath.
3 ^ Quoniam sagittae tuae infīxae sunt mihi, et confirmāvistī super mē manum tuam. ^ For thy arrows are fastened in me, and thy hand hath been strong upon me.
4 ^ Nōn est sānitās in carne meā, ā faciē īrae tuae; nōn est pāx ossibus meīs ā faciē peccātōrum meōrum. ^ There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath; there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.
5 ^ Quoniam inīquitātēs meae supergressae sunt caput meum, et sīcut onus grave gravātae sunt super mē. ^ For my iniquities are gone over my head, and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.
6 ^ Putruērunt et corruptae sunt cicātrīcēs meae, ā faciē insapientiae meae. ^ My sores are putrefied and corrupted, because of my foolishness.
7 ^ Miser factus sum et curvātus sum usque in fīnem; tōtā diē contrīstātus ingrediēbar. ^ I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end; I walked sorrowful all the day long.
8 ^ Quoniam lumbī meī implētī sunt illūsiōnibus, et nōn est sānitās in carne meā. ^ For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my flesh.
9 ^ Afflictus sum, et humiliātus sum nimis; rugiēbam ā gemitū cordis meī. ^ I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly; I roared with the groaning of my heart.
10 ^ Domine, ante tē omne dēsīderium meum, et gemitus meus ā tē nōn est absconditus. ^ Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
11 ^ Cor meum conturbātum est; dērelīquit mē virtūs mea, et lūmen oculōrum meōrum, et ipsum nōn est mēcum. ^ My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.
12 ^ Amīcī meī et proximī meī adversum mē appropinquāvērunt et stetērunt, et quī jūxtā mē erant, dē longē stetērunt. ^ My friends and my neighbours have drawn near and stood against me, and they that were near me stood afar off.
13 ^ Et vim faciēbant quī quaerēbant animam meam, et quī inquīrēbant mala mihi, locūtī sunt vānitātēs, et dolōs tōtā diē meditābantur. ^ And they that sought my soul used violence, and they that sought evils to me, they spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.
14 ^ Egō autem, tamquam surdus, nōn audiēbam, et sīcut mūtus nōn aperiens ōs suum. ^ But I, as a deaf man, heard not, and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
15 ^ Et factus sum sīcut homō nōn audiens, et nōn habens in ōre suō redargūtiōnēs. ^ And I became as a man that heareth not, and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.
16 ^ Quoniam in tē Domine spērāvī; tū exaudiēs mē Domine Deus meus. ^ For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped; thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
17 ^ Quia dīxī: Nēquandō supergaudeant mihi inimīcī meī. Et dum commoventur pedēs meī, super mē magna locūtī sunt. ^ For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me. And whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.
18 ^ Quoniam egō in flagella parātus sum, et dolor meus in conspectū meō semper. ^ For I am ready for scourges, and my sorrow is continually before me.
19 ^ Quoniam inīquitātem meam adnuntiābō, et cōgitābō prō peccātō meō. ^ For I will declare my iniquity, and I will think for my sin.
20 ^ Inimīcī autem meī vīvunt, et confirmātī sunt super mē, et multiplicātī sunt quī ōdērunt mē inīquē. ^ But my enemies live, and are stronger than I, and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
21 ^ Quī retribuunt mala prō bonīs, dētrahēbant mihi, quoniam sequēbar bonitātem. ^ They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness.
22 ^ Nē dērelinquās mē, Domine Deus meus; nē discesserīs ā mē. ^ For sake me not, O Lord my God; do not thou depart from me.
23 ^ Intende in adjūtōrium meum, Domine, Deus salūtis meae. ^ Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.
