2 ^ Miserēre meī, Deus, quoniam conculcāvit mē homō; tōtā diē impugnans trībulāvit mē. ^ Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.
3 ^ Conculcāvērunt mē inimīcī meī tōtā diē; quoniam multī bellantēs adversum mē. ^ My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many that make war against me.
4 ^ Ab altitūdine diēī timēbō, egō vērō in tē spērābō. ^ From the height of the day I shall fear, but I will trust in thee.
5 ^ In Deō laudābō sermōnēs meōs, in Deō spērāvī; nōn timēbō quid faciat mihī cārō. ^ In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do against me.
6 ^ Tōtā diē verba mea exsecrābantur; adversum mē omnēs cōgitātiōnēs eōrum in malum. ^ All the day long they detested my words; all their thoughts were against me unto evil.
7 ^ Inhabitābunt, et abscondent; ipsī calcāneum meum observābunt. Sīcut sustinuērunt animam meam, ^ They will dwell and hide themselves; they will watch my heel. As they have waited for my soul,
8 ^ prō nihilō salvōs faciēs illōs; in īrā populōs confringēs, Deus. ^ for nothing shalt thou save them; in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces. O God,
9 ^ Vītam meam adnūntiāvī tibī; posuistī lacrimās meās in conspectū tuō, sīcut et in prōmissiōne tuā; ^ I have declared to thee my life; thou hast set me tears in thy sight, as also in thy promise;
10 ^ tunc convertentur inimīcī meī retrōrsum. In quācumque diē invocāverō tē, ecce cognōvī quoniam Deus meus es. ^ then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.
11 ^ In Deō laudābō verbum; in Dominō laudābō sermōnem. In Deō spērāvī; nōn timēbō quid faciat mihī homō. ^ In God will I praise the word; in the Lord will I praise his speech. In God have I hoped; I will not fear what man can do to me.
12 ^ In mē sunt, Deus, vōta tua, quae reddem, laudātiōnēs tibī, ^ In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will pay, praises to thee,
13 ^ quoniam ēripuistī animam meam dē morte, et pedēs meōs dē lāpsū, ut placeam cōram Deō in lūmine vīventium. ^ because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling, that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.
