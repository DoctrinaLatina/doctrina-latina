1 ^ Nisi Dominus aedificāverit domum, in vānum labōrāvērunt quī aedificant eam. Nisi Dominus custōdīverit cīvitātem, frūstrā vigilat quī custōdit eam. ^ Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.
2 ^ Vānum est vōbīs ante lūcem surgere, surgite postquam sēderitis, quī mandūcātis pānem dolōris. Quum dederit dīlectīs suīs somnum. ^ It is vain for you to rise before light, rise ye after you have sat down, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved.
3 ^ Ecce hērēditās Dominī fīliī; mercēs, fructus ventris. ^ Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children; the reward, the fruit of the womb.
4 ^ Sīcut sagittae in manū potentis, ita fīliī excussōrum. ^ As arrows in the hand of the mighty, so the children of them that have been shaken.
5 ^ Beātus vir quī implēvit dēsīderium suum ex ipsīs; nōn confundētur quum loquētur inimīcīs suīs in portā. ^ Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.
