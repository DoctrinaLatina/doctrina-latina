2 ^ Deus, auribus nostrīs audīvimus; patrēs nostrī adnuntiāvērunt nōbīs, opus quod operātus es in diēbus eōrum, et in diēbus antīquīs. ^ O God, we have heard with our ears; our fathers have declared to us, the work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.
3 ^ Manus tua gentēs disperdidit, et plantāstī eōs; afflīxistī populōs, et expulistī eōs; ^ Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them; thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out;
4 ^ nec enim in gladiō suō possēdērunt terram, et bracchium eōrum nōn salvāvit eōs; sed dextera tua et bracchium tuum, et illūminātiō vultūs tuī, quoniam complacuistī in eīs. ^ for not by their own sword did they inherit the land, and their own arm did not save them; rather thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou wast pleased with them.
5 ^ Tū es ipse rēx meus et Deus meus, quī mandās salūtēs Jācōbī. ^ Thou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the saving for Jacob.
6 ^ In tē inimīcōs nostrōs ventilābimus cornū, et in nōmine tuō spernēmus insurgentēs in nōbīs. ^ Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn, and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.
7 ^ Nōn enim in arcū meō spērābō, et gladius meus nōn salvābit mē. ^ For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me.
8 ^ Salvāstī enim nōs dē afflīgentibus nōs, et odientēs nōs confūdistī. ^ But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us, and hast put them to shame that hate us.
9 ^ In Deō laudābimur tōtā diē, et in nōmine tuō confitēbimur in saeculum. ^ In God shall we glory all the day long, and in thy name we will give praise for ever.
10 ^ Nunc autem repulistī et confūdistī nōs, et nōn ēgrediēris, Deus, in virtūtibus nostrīs. ^ But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame, and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies.
11 ^ Āvertistī nōs retrōrsum post inimīcōs nostrōs, et quī ōdērunt nōs, dīripiēbant sibi. ^ Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies, and they that hated us plundered for themselves.
12 ^ Dedistī nōs tamquam ovēs ēscārum, et in Gentibus dispersistī nōs. ^ Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten, and thou hast scattered us among the nations.
13 ^ Vendidistī populum tuum sine pretiō, et nōn fuit multitūdō in commūtātiōnibus eōrum. ^ Thou hast sold thy people for no price, and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them.
14 ^ Posuistī nōs opprobrium vīcīnīs nostrīs; subsannātiōnem et dērīsum hīs quī sunt in circumitū nostrō. ^ Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours; a scoff and derision to them that are round about us.
15 ^ Posuistī nōs in similitūdinem Gentibus; commōtiōnem capitis in populīs. ^ Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles; a shaking of the head among the people.
16 ^ Tōtā diē verēcundia mea contrā mē est, et confūsiō faciēī meae cooperuit mē, ^ All the day long my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face hath covered me,
17 ^ ā vōce exprōbrantis et obloquentis, ā faciē inimīcī et persequentis. ^ at the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me; at the face of the enemy and persecutor.
18 ^ Haec omnia vēnērunt super nōs, nec oblītī sumus tē, et inīquē nōn ēgimus in testāmentō tuō. ^ All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee, and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.
19 ^ Et nōn recessit retrō cor nostrum, et dēclīnāstī sēmitās nostrās ā viā tuā, ^ And our heart hath not turned back, and thou hast diverted our steps from thy way,
20 ^ quoniam humiliāstī nōs in locō afflīctiōnis, et cooperuit nōs umbra mortis. ^ for thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction, and the shadow of death hath covered us.
21 ^ Sī oblītī sumus nōmen Deī nostrī, et sī expandimus manūs nostrās ad deum aliēnum, ^ If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god,
22 ^ nōnne Deus requīret ista? Ipse enim nōvit abscondita cordis. Quoniam propter tē mortificāmur tōtā diē; aestimātī sumus sīcut ovēs occīsiōnis. ^ shall not God search out these things? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
23 ^ Exsurge, quārē obdormīs, Domine? Exsurge, et nē repellās in fīnem. ^ Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the end.
24 ^ Quārē faciem tuam āvertis? Oblīvīsceris inopiae nostrae et trībulātiōnis nostrae? ^ Why turnest thou thy face away? Why forgettest our want and our trouble?
25 ^ Quoniam humiliāta est in pulvere anima nostra; conglūtinātus est in terrā venter noster. ^ For our soul is humbled down to the dust; our belly cleaveth to the earth.
26 ^ Exsurge, Domine, adjuvā nōs, et redime nōs propter nōmen tuum. ^ Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for thy name's sake.
