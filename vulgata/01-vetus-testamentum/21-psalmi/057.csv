2 ^ Sī vērē utique jūstitiam loquiminī, rēctā jūdicāte, fīliī hominum. ^ If in very deed ye speak justice, judge right things, ye sons of men.
3 ^ Etenim in corde inīquitātēs operāminī; in terrā injūstitiās manūs vestrae concinnant. ^ For in your heart you work iniquity; your hands forge injustice in the earth.
4 ^ Aliēnātī sunt peccātōrēs ā vulvā, errāvērunt ab uterō; locūtī sunt falsa. ^ The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb; they have spoken false things.
5 ^ Furor illīs secundum similitūdinem serpentis, sīcut aspidis surdae et obtūrantīs aurēs suās, ^ Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent, like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears,
6 ^ quae nōn exaudiet vōcem incantantium, et venēficī incantantis sapienter. ^ which will not hear the voice of those enchanting, nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.
7 ^ Deus conteret dentēs eōrum in ōre ipsōrum; molās leōnum confringet Dominus. ^ God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth; the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.
8 ^ Ad nihilum dēvenient tamquam aqua dēcurrens; intendit arcum suum dōnec infirmentur. ^ They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.
9 ^ Sīcut cēra quae fluit auferentur, supercecidit ignis, et nōn vīdērunt sōlem. ^ Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away, fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.
10 ^ Priusquam intellegerent spīnae vestrae rhamnum, sīcut vīventēs sīc in īrā absorbet eōs. ^ Before your thorns could know the brier, he swalloweth them up, as alive, in his wrath.
11 ^ Laetābitur jūstus quum vīderit vindictam; manūs suās lavābit in sanguine peccātōris. ^ The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
12 ^ Et dīcet homō, « Sī utique est fructūs jūstō, utique est Deus jūdicans eōs in terrā. » ^ And man shall say, "If indeed there be fruit to the just, there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth."
