7 ^ Et meditātus sum nocte cum corde meō, et exercitābar, et scopēbam spīritum meum. ^ And I meditated in the night with my own heart, and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
8 ^ ¿Numquid in aeternum prōjiciet Deus, et nōn appōnet ut complacitior sit adhūc? ^ Will God then cast off for ever, and will he never be more favourable again?
9 ^ ¿Aut in fīnem misericordiam suam abscindet, ā generātiōne in generātiōnem? ^ Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?
10 ^ ¿Aut oblīvīscētur miserērī Deus? ¿Aut continēbit in īrā suā misericordiās suās? ^ Or will God forget to show mercy? Or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?

14 ^ Deus, in sānctō via tua; ¿quis Deus magnus sīcut Deus noster? ^ Thy way, O God, is in the holy place; who is the great God like our God?
15 ^ Tū es Deus quī facis mīrābilia; nōtam fēcistī in populīs virtūtem tuam. ^ Thou art the God that dost wonders; thou hast made thy power known among the nations.
16 ^ Redēmistī in bracchiō tuō populum tuum, fīliōs Jācōbis et Jōsēfī. ^ With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people, the children of Jacob and of Joseph.

18 ^ Multitūdō sonitūs aquārum; vōcem dedērunt nūbēs, etenim sagittae tuae transiunt. ^ Great are the roarings of the waters; the clouds sent out a sound, and indeed thy arrows pass.
19 ^ Vōx tonitruī tuī in rotā; illūxērunt coruscātiōnēs tuae orbī terrae; commōta est, et contremuit terra. ^ The voice of thy thunder in a wheel; thy lightnings enlightened the world; the earth shook and trembled.
20 ^ In marī via tua, et sēmitae tuae in aquīs multīs, et vestīgia tua nōn cognōscentur. ^ Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps shall not be known.
21 ^ Dēdūxistī sīcut ovēs populum tuum, in manū Mōsis et Aarōnis. ^ Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
