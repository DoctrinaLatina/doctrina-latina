2 ^ Audīte haec, omnēs gentēs; auribus percipite omnēs, quī habitātis orbem, ^ Hear these things, all ye nations; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,
3 ^ quīque terrigenae, et fīliī hominum, simul in ūnum dīves et pauper. ^ all you that are earthborn, and you sons of men, both rich and poor together.
4 ^ Ōs meum loquētur sapientiam, et meditātiō cordis meī prūdentiam. ^ My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart understanding.
5 ^ Inclīnābō in parabolam aurem meam; aperiem in psaltēriō prōpositiōnem meam. ^ I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.
6 ^ ¿Cūr timēbō in diē malā? Inīquitās calcāneī meī circumdabit mē. ^ Why shall I fear in the evil day? The iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.
7 ^ Quī confīdunt in virtūte suā, et in multitūdine dīvitiārum suārum glōriantur. ^ They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,
8 ^ Frāter nōn redimit, redimet homō; nōn dabit Deō plācātiōnem suam, ^ No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem; he shall not give to God his ransom,
9 ^ et pretium redemptiōnis animae suae, et labōrābit in aeternum, ^ nor the price of the redemption of his soul, and shall labour for ever,
10 ^ et vīvet adhūc in fīnem. ^ and shall still live unto the end.
11 ^ Nōn vidēbit interitum, quum vīderit sapientēs morientēs. Simul insapiens et stultus perībunt, et relinquent aliēnīs dīvitiās suās. ^ He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying. The senseless and the fool shall perish together, and they shall leave their riches to strangers.
12 ^ Et sepulchra eōrum domūs illōrum in aeternum, tabernācula eōrum in prōgeniē et prōgeniē; vocāvērunt nōmina sua in terrīs suīs. ^ And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever, their dwelling places unto generation and generation; they have called their names upon their own lands.
13 ^ Et homō, quum in honōre esset, nōn intellēxit; comparātus est jūmentīs insapientibus, et similis factus est illīs. ^ And man, when he was in honour, did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.
14 ^ Haec via illōrum scandalum ipsīs, et posteā in ōre suō complacēbunt. ^ This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them, and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.
15 ^ Sīcut ovēs in infernō positī sunt; mors dēpāscet eōs, et dominābuntur eōrum jūstī in mātūtīnō, et auxilium eōrum veterāscet in infernō ā glōriā eōrum. ^ They are laid in hell like sheep; death shall feed upon them, and the just shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.
16 ^ Vērumtamen Deus redimet animam meam dē manū inferī, quum accēperit mē. ^ But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.
17 ^ Nē timuerīs quum dīves factus fuerit homō, et quum multiplicāta fuerit glōria domūs ejus, ^ Be not thou afraid when a man shall be made rich, and when the glory of his house shall be increased,
18 ^ quoniam, quum interīverit, nōn sūmet omnia, neque dēscendet cum eō glōria ejus. ^ for, when he shall die, he shall take nothing away, nor shall his glory descend with him.
19 ^ Quia anima ejus in vītā ipsīus benedīcētur; confitēbitur tibī quum benefēcerīs eī. ^ For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed; he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.
20 ^ Introībit usque in prōgeniēs patrum suōrum, et usque in aeternum nōn vidēbit lūmen. ^ He shall go in to the generations of his fathers, and he shall never see light.
21 ^ Homō, quum in honōre esset, nōn intellēxit; comparātus est jūmentīs insapientibus, et similis factus est illīs. ^ Man, when he was in honour, did not understand; he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.
