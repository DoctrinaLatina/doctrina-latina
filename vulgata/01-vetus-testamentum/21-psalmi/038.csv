2 ^ Dīxī: Cūstōdiam viās meās, ut nōn dēlinquam in linguā meā. Posuī ōrī meō cūstōdiam, quum consisteret peccātor adversum mē. ^ I said: I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me.
3 ^ Obmūtuī, et humiliātus sum, et siluī ā bonīs, et dolor meus renovātus est. ^ I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things, and my sorrow was renewed.
4 ^ Concaluit cor meum intrā mē, et in meditātiōne meā exardēscet ignis. ^ My heart grew hot within me, and in my meditation a fire shall flame out.
5 ^ Locūtus sum in linguā meā: Nōtum fac mihi, Domine, fīnem meum, et numerum diērum meōrum quis est, ut sciam quid dēsit mihi. ^ I spoke with my tongue: Make know to me, O Lord, my end, and what is the number of my days, that I may know what is wanting to me.
6 ^ Ecce mensūrābilēs posuistī diēs meōs, et substantia mea tamquam nihilum ante tē. Vērumtamen ūniversa vānitās, omnis homō vīvens. ^ Behold thou hast made my days measurable, and my substance is as nothing before thee. Surely all things are vanity, every man living.
7 ^ Vērumtamen in imāgine pertransit homō; sed et frūstrā conturbātur. Thēsaurizat, et ignōrat cui congregābit ea. ^ Surely man passeth as an image; but even he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up, and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.
8 ^ Et nunc quae est expectātiō mea? Nōnne Dominus? Et substantia mea apud tē est. ^ And now what is my hope? Is it not the Lord? And my substance is with thee.
9 ^ Ab omnibus inīquitātibus meīs ērue mē; opprobrium insapientī dedistī mē. ^ Deliver thou me from all my iniquities; thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.
10 ^ Obmūtuī, et nōn aperuī ōs meum, quoniam tū fēcistī. ^ I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.
11 ^ Āmovē ā mē plāgās tuās; ā fortitūdine manūs tuae egō dēfēcī in increpātiōnibus. ^ Remove thy scourges from me; the strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes.
12 ^ Propter inīquitātem corripuistī hominem, et tābēscere fēcistī sīcut arāneam animam ejus; vērumtamen vānē conturbātur omnis homō. ^ Thou hast corrected man for iniquity, and thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider; surely in vain is any man disquieted.
13 ^ Exaudī ōrātiōnem meam, Domine, et dēprecātiōnem meam; auribus percipe lacrimās meās. Nē sileās, quoniam advena egō sum apud tē, et peregrīnus sīcut omnēs patrēs meī. ^ Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication; give ear to my tears. Be no silent, for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were.
14 ^ Remitte mihi, ut refrīgerer priusquam abiam, et amplius nōn erō. ^ Forgive me, that I may be refreshed before I go hence, and be no more.
