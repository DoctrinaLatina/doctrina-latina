2 ^ Verba mea auribus percipe, Domine; intellege clāmōrem meum. ^ Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.
3 ^ Intende vōcī ōrātiōnis meae, rēx meus et Deus meus. ^ Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.
4 ^ Quoniam ad tē ōrābō, Domine; manē exaudiēs vōcem meam. ^ For to thee will I pray; O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice.
5 ^ Manē astābō tibi et vidēbō, quoniam nōn Deus volens inīquitātem tū es. ^ In the morning I will stand before thee, and I will see, because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.
6 ^ Neque habitābit jūxtā tē malignus, neque permanēbunt injūstī ante oculōs tuōs. ^ Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee, nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.
7 ^ Ōdistī omnēs quī operantur inīquitātem; perdēs omnēs, quī loquuntur mendācium. Virum sanguinum et dolōsum abōminābitur Dominus. ^ Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity; thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.
8 ^ Egō autem in multitūdine misericordiae tuae, introībō in domum tuam; adōrābō ad templum sānctum tuum in timōre tuō. ^ But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.
9 ^ Domine, dēdūc mē in jūstitiā tuā; propter inimīcōs meōs dīrige in conspectū tuō viam meam. ^ Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice; because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.
10 ^ Quoniam nōn est in ōre eōrum vēritās; cor eōrum vānum est. ^ For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain.
11 ^ Sepulchrum patens est guttur eōrum; linguīs suīs dolōsē agēbant; jūdicā illōs, Deus. Dēcidant ā cōgitātiōnibus suīs; secundum multitūdinem impietātum eōrum expelle eōs, quoniam irrītāvērunt tē, Domine. ^ Their throat is an open sepulchre; they dealt deceitfully with their tongues; judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices; according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out, for they have provoked thee, O Lord.
12 ^ Et laetentur omnēs quī spērant in tē; in aeternum exsultābunt, et habitābis in eīs. Et glōriābuntur in tē omnēs, quī dīligunt nōmen tuum, ^ But let all them be glad that hope in thee; they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee,
13 ^ quoniam tū benedīcēs jūstō. Domine, ut scūtō bonae voluntātis tuae corōnāvistī nōs. ^ for thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned us as with a shield of thy good will.
