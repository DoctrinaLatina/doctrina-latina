3 ^ Probāstī cor meum, et vīsitāstī nocte; igne mē exāmināstī, et nōn est inventa in mē inīquitās. ^ Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night; thou hast tried me by fire, and iniquity hath not been found in me.
4 ^ Ut nōn loquātur ōs meum opera hominum; propter verba labiōrum tuōrum, egō cūstōdīvī viās dūrās. ^ That my mouth may not speak the works of men; for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.

9 ^ ā faciē impiōrum quī mē afflīxērunt. Inimīcī meī animam meam circumdedērunt; ^ from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul;
10 ^ adipem suum conclūsērunt; ōs eōrum locūtum est superbiam. ^ they have shut up their fat; their mouth hath spoken proudly.

14 ^ Domine, ā paucīs dē terrā dīvide eōs in vītā eōrum; dē absconditīs tuīs adimplētus est venter eōrum. Saturātī sunt fīliīs, et dīmīsērunt reliquiās suās parvulīs suīs. ^ O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life; their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children, and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.
15 ^ Egō autem in jūstitiā appārēbō conspectuī tuō; satiābor quum appāruerit glōria tua. ^ But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice; I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.
