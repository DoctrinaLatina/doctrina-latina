2^Domine, nē in furōre tuō arguās mē, neque in īrā tuā corripiās mē.^O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath.
3^Miserēre meī, Domine, quoniam infirmus sum; sānā mē, Domine, quoniam conturbāta sunt ossa mea.^Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak; heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.
4^Et anima mea turbāta est valdē; sed tū, Domine, usquequo?^And my soul is troubled exceedingly; but thou, O Lord, how long?
5^Convertere, Domine, et ēripe animam meam; salvum mē fac propter misericordiam tuam.^Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul; O save me for thy mercy's sake.
6^Quoniam nōn est in morte quī memor sit tuī; in infernō autem quis confitēbitur tibi?^For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee; and who shall confess to thee in hell?
7^Labōrāvī in gemitū meō, lavābō per singulās noctēs lectum meum; lacrimīs meīs strātum meum rigābō.^I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears.
8^Turbātus est ā furōre oculus meus; inveterāvī inter omnēs inimīcōs meōs.^My eye is troubled through indignation; I have grown old amongst all my enemies.
9^Discēdite ā mē omnēs quī operāminī inīquitātem, quoniam exaudīvit Dominus vōcem flētūs meī.^Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
10^Exaudīvit Dominus dēprecātiōnem meam; Dominus ōrātiōnem meam suscēpit.^The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord hath received my prayer.
11^Ērubēscant, et conturbentur vehementer, omnēs inimīcī meī; convertantur, et ērubēscant valdē vēlōciter.^Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled; let them be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.
