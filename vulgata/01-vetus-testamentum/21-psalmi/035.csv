2 ^ Dīxit injūstus ut dēlinquat in sēmet ipsō; nōn est timor Deī ante oculōs ejus. ^ The unjust hath declared within himself that he might sin; there is no fear of God before his eyes.
3 ^ Quoniam dolōsē ēgit in conspectū ejus, ut inveniātur inīquitās ejus ad odium. ^ For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.
4 ^ Verba ōris ejus inīquitās et dolus; nōluit intellegere ut bene ageret. ^ The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile; he has not wished to understand that he might do well.
5 ^ Inīquitātem meditātus est in cubīlī suō; astitit omnī viae nōn bonae, malitiam autem nōn ōdīvit. ^ He hath devised iniquity on his bed; he hath set himself on every way that is not good, but evil he hath not hated.
6 ^ Domine, in caelō misericordia tua, et vēritās tua usque ad nūbēs. ^ O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.
7 ^ Jūstitia tua sīcut montēs Deī; jūdicia tua abissus multa. Hominēs et jūmenta salvābis, Domine. ^ Thy justice is as the mountains of God; thy judgments are a great deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord.
8 ^ Quemadmodum multiplicāvistī misericordiam tuam, Deus. Fīliī autem hominum in tegmine ālārum tuārum spērābunt. ^ How hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of men shall put their trust under the cover of thy wings.
9 ^ Inēbriābuntur ab ūbertāte domūs tuae, et torrente voluptātis tuae pōtābis eōs. ^ They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house, and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.
10 ^ Quoniam apud tē est fons vītae, et in lūmine tuō vidēbimus lūmen. ^ For with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light we shall see light.
11 ^ Praetende misericordiam tuam scientibus tē, et jūstitiam tuam hīs quī rēctō sunt corde. ^ Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them that are right in heart.
12 ^ Nōn veniat mihī pēs superbiae, et manus peccātōris nōn moveat mē. ^ Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the sinner move me.
13 ^ Ibī cecidērunt quī operantur inīquitātem; expulsī sunt, nec potuērunt stāre. ^ There the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and could not stand.
