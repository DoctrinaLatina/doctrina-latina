Fratres: Sōbriī estōte, et vigilāte, quia adversārius vester diabolus tamquam leō rūgiens círcuit, quaerens quem dēvoret, cui resistite fortes in fide. Tū autem, Domine, miserēre nōbīs. ^ Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour, whom resist ye, strong in faith. But thou, O Lord, have mercy on us.
$R Deō grātiās. ^ Thanks be to God.
$V Adjūtōrium nostrum in nōmine Domine, ^ Our help is in the name of the Lord,
$R quī fēcit caelum et terram. ^ who hath made heaven and the earth.
